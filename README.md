# Auto Hide Zendesk Composer

This is a user script to automatically hide the Zendesk reply composer when there is no draft reply written on the ticket. This only applies to the Zendesk Agent Workspace and not the legacy Zendesk workspaces. 

By default, the Zendesk reply composer shows itself when it has been shown on the previously viewed ticket. This user script hides the reply composer in all cases except when you have a draft written for a ticket - if a draft is written, that ticket's composer will not be hidden.

This user script was written for [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), but can likely work with other user script managers. 

To use this script, make sure you have a user script manager installed, then click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BagToad/Auto-Hide-Zendesk-Composer/main/auto-hide-composers.user.js).

If you have trouble importing, you can copy and paste [the script](https://github.com/BagToad/Auto-Hide-Zendesk-Composer/blob/main/auto-hide-composers.user.js) into a new user script in your user script manager manually.
