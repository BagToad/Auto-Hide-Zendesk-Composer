# Auto-Hide Zendesk Composer - A User Script

Auto-Hide Zendesk Composer is a user script designed to streamline your experience with Zendesk by automatically hiding the reply composer when no draft reply exists on a ticket. This feature is specific to the Zendesk Agent Workspace and does not apply to older legacy Zendesk versions.

## Why this User Script?

Zendesk's current default setting keeps the reply composer open based on its state in the previously viewed ticket. This could create unwanted clutter, particularly when there's no draft written. This user script ensures a more organized workspace by hiding the reply composer unless a draft is present.

## Compatibility and Installation

This script is primarily written for [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), one of the popular userscript managers. However, it may be compatible with other user script managers as well - do give it a try!

To install this script, follow these simple steps:

-   Make sure you have a user script manager installed.
-   Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BagToad/Auto-Hide-Zendesk-Composer/main/auto-hide-composers.user.js) to directly import the script.

Having trouble importing? Not to worry. You can manually copy and paste [the script](https://github.com/BagToad/Auto-Hide-Zendesk-Composer/blob/main/auto-hide-composers.user.js) into a new user script in your user script manager.
